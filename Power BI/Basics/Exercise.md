1. Identify the stakeholders
	1. Product team(help them see which products are of interest to the customers and if the products is similar enough to the new product that is being launched)
	2. Marketing team(help them see if the product that they have been marketing are having an increase in sales and what products might need more marketing)

2. Identify and consider the data sources
	1. We can see for each order and all the details in this order and what product has been ordered and it characteristics. For the costumer we only have the customer id
	2. We can see what products are ordered the most, at what frequency a costumer order them on average
	3. Customer data would be valuable as well to understand our costumer demographic, marketing data would allow to see the correlation between marketing and sales for each product
