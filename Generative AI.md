## Terminology
- AI
	- field of computing focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would require human intelligence
	- Reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception
- ML
	- development of algorithms and statistical models
	- enable computers to perform tasks without instructions
	- Supervised learning
	- unsupervised learning(Identifying patterns)
	- Reinforcement learning(learning through feedback)
- Data Handling and processing
	- data preprocessing
		- normalization
		- handling missing values
		- feature selection
- DL
	- uses artificial NN with multiple layers
	- can learn from large amounts of unstructured data
	- Used in
		- image recognition
		- NLP
		- speech recognition
- NN
	- for pattern recognition and data interpretations tasks
	- neurons,weights and biases
	- backpropagation
		- minimize errors
- NLP
	- interaction between humans and computers through Natural language
	- goal: read, decipher, understand and make sense of human languages in manner that is valuable
	- used in
		- chatbots, translation services
		- email filtering
- Transformers
	- uses mechanism known as self-attention to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence, regardless of its position
	- also uses FC layers
	- Process all words/tokens in parallel
		- better efficiency and performance 
	- avoids recurrence and convolutions

- Generative pre-trained transformers
	- use transformer architecture
	- first pre-trained on diverse range of text to develop broad understanding of language
		- unsupervised learning
	- allow to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text sequences
	- Uses pre-trained, model can be fine-tuned on specific tasks

- Tokenization, Word2vec and Bert
	- Word2vec: uses shallow, two-kayer NNs
		- uses to reconstruct the linugistic contexts of words
	- Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer
		- incorporates a transformer architecture that processes words in relation to all the other words in a sentence
			- captures full context of word

## Business usage cases
- gives new insights, ideas and efficiencies


## GANs
- generators: creates new data
- discriminator: evaluate them
- goal:
	- Discriminator cant distinguish between real and fake

## Transformer
- GPT und BERT
- Use attention mechanisms to create text that is contextually relevant und stylistically coherent
- Focus selectively on input data
	- Highlight important info
	- Coherent and contextually appropriate
- Depends on size and quality of training data


## Limitation and ethical concerns
- Quality of output can vary
- Inaccuracies can emerge
- potential to amplify biases
- Bad at reasoning

- Data privacy
- intellectal property
- potential for misuse

- need clear guidelines and ethical frameworks

- AI integration not seemless
- job displacement
- Inconsistent quality
	- especially with deep understanding or emotional intelligence

- black box nature
	- lack of transparency
	- problem in high stake environment
		- healthcare
- responsibility
	- how is responsible
		- AI
		- User
		- AI developer
## Benifits
- productivity
- decision-making
- customer-engagement
